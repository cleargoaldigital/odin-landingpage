PROJECT: LANDING PAGE

This is the first major assignment on the Odin Project Online class.

I am expected to design a landing page that looks almost exactly, or at least, much like the original design the image of which comes with the assignment.

The link to the image is herewith attached: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png
